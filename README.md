# rimworldmod-pawnkindracediversification

Was a personal mod that I created and used for myself, but I decided to publish it to the workshop as my first mod.

This project was discontinued many years ago due to my loss of interest in modding at the time. I am unlikely to pick it back up again, as I want to move on to other things.
